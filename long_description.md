This project investigates how we could extract information on the effects of drought on animals.

We want to answer questions like:

1. What animals are found in the area?
2. What condition are they in? Are the healthy?
3. Are they alive or dead?

### How does it work?
You will be presented with an image from drought in Somalia and asked a series of questions about what you see in the photo.

You can **[take the tutorial](http://geotagx.org/project/animals_tutorial/newtask)** before starting so you know what to look for.

**Don't worry if you are not sure about your answer**, each photo is presented to at least 30 people and the final answers are taken from the majority response.

**If you can't see what is in the photo** select "I DON'T KNOW" - this is a good	 answer!

**Don't worry if several photos seem irrelevant**, sometimes you might click through several photos before finding one you can analyse. The same photos are presented in multiple projects on topics such as agriculture, soil and water. While a photo may not be relevant for this analysis, it may be relevant to another.

If you want more information on what sort of data is collected before, during, and after a disaster, have a look at the [Field Operations Guide for Disaster Assessment and Response](https://scms.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1866/fog_v4.pdf) produced by [USAID](http://www.usaid.gov/).

### What are we doing with the results?
Results will help us improve this project and others like it so that they could be deployed during a real drought or other disaster situations.
More generally we will also use these results to determine how these types of applications could be best used in a disaster situation.
